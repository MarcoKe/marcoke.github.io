        <h1 id="genterm">General Terminology</h1>
        <h4>Afferent vs Efferent Neurons</h4>
        In an effort to create sane terminology, neuroscientists have decided to call neurons that receive sensory input and transmit it to the central nervous system  <em>afferent</em> neurons, while neurons that send information in the opposite direction are called <em>efferent</em>.

        <br>
        <h4>Coincidence Detection</h4>
        Since a coincidence is by definition meaningless it seems pointless to want to detect one. Taking a more literal definition of the word, it becomes clear that we are trying to detect inputs that coincide, i.e. arrive at approximately the same time.

        <br> <br>
        <h1 id="neocortex">The Neocortex</h1>
        The neocortex, part of the cerebral cortex, is a part of the brain that evolved in mammals comparatively recently (hence <em>neo</em>cortex). It comprises around 80% of the human brain <a href="#markram2004">[3]</a> and is therefore often speculated to be responsible for the emergence of higher intelligence. <br> <br>

        The neocortex appears to have a distinct structure which is characterised by its organisation into layers as well as columns. The columnar organisation is based on the observation that neurons stacked on top of each other tend to be connected and have similar response properties, while only few connections exist between columns. Columns are hence hypothesised to be a basic functional unit in the cortex, although this is somewhat debated in the neuroscience community <a href="#goodhill2002">[4]</a>. <br><br>

        The further organisation into six layers was proposed by Brodmann in 1909.

        <br><br>
        <strong>Layer 1:</strong> Next to no cell bodies, mostly connections between axons and the apical dendrites of <a href="#pyrneu">pyramidal neurons</a> <a href="#shipp2007">[6]</a>.<br>
        <strong>Layer 2&amp;3:</strong> <br>
        <strong>Layer 4:</strong> Receives input from either the thalamus or other cortical regions and relays signals to layer 2&amp;3 <a href="#shipp2007">[6]</a>. <br>
        <strong>Layer 5:</strong> Houses large pyramidal neurons with axons leaving the cortex <a href="#shipp2007">[6]</a>.<br>
        <strong>Layer 6:</strong> Forms loops with the thalamus, i.e. sends signals to neurons in the thalamus who then in turn send signals to layer 1 neurons in the same column <a href="#shipp2007">[6]</a>. <br><br>

        Layer 4 is also called the <em>granular</em> layer while layers 1-3 are called <em>supragranular</em> and layers 5 &amp; 6 are called <em>infragranular</em>.

        <h1>The Thalamus</h1>

        <br> <br>
        <h1 id="aps">Action Potentials</h1>
        Input to the receptors of a neuron can either be inhibitory, i.e. decreasing the probability of producing an action potential (often through GABA), or excitatory, i.e. increasing the probability of producing an action potential (often through glutamate).
        <h4>Postsynaptic Potentials</h4>
        <br><br>

        <h1 id="pyrneu"> Pyramidal Neurons </h1>
        Pyramidal neurons are the most abundant type of neuron in the neocortex, constituting about 70-85% of cells <a href="#defelipe1992">[0]</a>. In contrast to the remaining neurons in the neocortex, so called <em>interneurons</em>, which are mostly inhibitory, pyramidal neurons are excitatory <a href="#defelipe1992">[0]</a>. <br><br>

        As the name suggests, pyramidal neurons have a cell body (or <em>soma</em>) shaped like a pyramid. This cell body is said to have a <em>base</em> at the bottom and an <em>apex</em> at the top. <br>
        <center><img src="img/apexbase.png"></center>

        <br>
        Pyramidal neurons have two groups of dendrites: <em>basal dendrites</em>, originating at the base of the soma, and one <em>apical dendrite</em>, originating at the apex of the soma. This apical dendrite terminates (not always, but mostly in layer 1  <a href="#defelipe1992">[0]</a>) in what is called the <em>apical tuft</em>. The dendrites branching off from the main apical dendrite are called oblique dendrites.
        <br><br>

        These apical and basal dendrites are not just differently located, they also appear to serve different functions.

        Basal dendrites receive regular feed-forward input, while the apical tuft dendrites receive feed-back input. <br> <br>

        <center><img src="img/pyr.png" width="700"></center> <br> <br>


        <br>

        While the Na<sup>+</sup> action potential (AP) initiation zone at the soma was long thought to be the only one (?), it is now clear that there is a second Ca<sup>2+</sup> AP initiation zone near the tuft <a href="#defelipe1992">[1]</a>.
        These two AP initiation zones influence each other, i.e. a subthreshold excitatory postsynaptic potential in the apical tuft can cause APs in the axon when it coincides with a back-propagating AP from the axon <a href="#larkum1999">[2]</a>.
