A cellular mechanism for cortical associations: an organising principe for the cerebral cortex

Abstract:
- ability to freely associate aspects of perceived experience with an internal representation of the world & ability to make prediction about the future are a basic feature of the cortex
- hypothesis: performance derives from an associative mechanism at the cellular level of basic cortical neuronal unit: the pyramidal cell
- ————————————————————
- view: cellular properties and architecture of the cortex are highly coupled
- seemingly bizarre architecture of the cortex:
    - sensory input terminates in the middle layers
    - information form other parts of the cortex (feedback stream) tends to project to outer layers
    - also applies to thalamus (gateway for feed forward sensory information to the cortex and hub for feedback interaction between cortical regions
- Thalamus:
    - (sensory input) relay regions of thalamus project to relatively specific region of the cortex (“specific nuclei”)
    - but most areas of the thalamus receive input predominantly from the cortex and project back to it in a relatively non specific fashion (“non-specific nuclei”).

There is tons of stuff about Calcium thingies that goes completely over my head. Should I try to understand this?
