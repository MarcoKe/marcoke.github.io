        <h1> Matrix Vector Multiplication / Linear Transformations </h1>
  <div id="graph" style="width: 600px; height: 600px"></div>



  basis vectors: a = [1,0], b = [0,1] <br>
  These vectors span the whole of R^2. Every other vector can be expressed as a linear combination of a and b. <br>
  vector v is a linear combination of a and b: v = 2*a + 3*b = [2, 3] <br><br>

  if we change the basis to: a = [0, 1], b = [-1, 0] (this corresponds to a 90 degree counter clockwise rotation), v will be rotated in the same way:

<div id="graph2" style="width: 600px; height: 600px"></div>
  <script src="la.js"></script>


  Instead of changing the basis directly, we could apply a linear transformation. <br> This corresponds to a matrix multiplication: [0 1; -1 0] * v = 2 [0, 1] + 3 [-1, 0]
  <br> So we can see matrix vector multiplication as changing the basis of the corresponding vector.

  <h1>Matrix Multiplication / Composition Of Linear Transformations </h1>
  M2*M2*v<br>
  This means: we are first applying the linear transformation M1 to vector v, and then we apply M2 to the result. <br>This, compositional transformation can also be represented in a single matrix: <br>
  M1*M2

  <h1>Determinants</h1>
Determinants are the scaling factor of the transformation described by a matrix <br>
The determinant of a matrix is 0 iff the column vectors (or row vectors) are linearly independent. <br>
If a 2x2 matrix A that represents a linear transformation has det(A)=0, then the transformed vectors will not span R^2 anymore ("area is scaled by 0", if we were talking about 3x3 matrix, they wouldn't span R^3 anymore. Instead of a volume, the vectors would span a line or an area).
