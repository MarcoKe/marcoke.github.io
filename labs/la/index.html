  basis vectors: a = [1,0], b = [0,1] <br>
  These vectors span the whole of R^2. Every other vector can be expressed as a linear combination of a and b. <br>
  vector c is a linear combination of a and b: c = 2*a + 3*b = [2, 3] <br><br>

  if we change the basis to: a = [0, 1], b = [-1, 0] (this corresponds to a 90 degree counter clockwise rotation), c will be rotated in the same way:

  Instead of changing the basis directly, we could apply a linear transformation. <br> This corresponds to a matrix multiplication: [0 1; -1 0] * c
  <br> So we can see matrix vector multiplication as changing the basis of the corresponding vector.
