            Title: <strong>On the Integrality of the LP-relaxation for MaxRTC</strong><br> 
            Abstract: Supertree methods aim to merge multiple phylogenetic trees while resolving any conflicts, by some criterion, gracefully. 
            One way to construct such supertrees is to solve the maximum rooted triplets consistency problem (MaxRTC), 
            in which, given a set of rooted triplets, a maximum cardinality subset is selected
            that can be displayed by a single tree. MaxRTC is NP-hard and no known
            polynomial-time approximation algorithm better than a 3-approximation exists.
            When formulated as an ILP, it turns out that the problem can be solved surprisingly fast under certain conditions and that the corresponding LP-relaxation is
            surprisingly integral under those conditions. Here, we investigate these conditions and determine a certain level of inconsistency in the input above which
            solutions to the LP-relaxation cannot be integral. Based on our results, it is
            not clear how an approximation algorithm based on a rounding scheme of the
            LP-relaxation can be designed, although we cannot rule out that such a rounding scheme exists. Additionally, our results show that constraining only small
            subsets of decision variables to be integer often results in completely integral
            solutions. Although we have thus far been unable to leverage these insights
            to obtain improved algorithms, they deepen our understanding of the underlying combinatorial structure of the problem and yield a new array of interesting
            questions, which we reflect upon.

                Title: <strong>Feedback-Gated Rectified Linear Units </strong><br>
                Abstract: Feedback connections play a prominent role in the human brain but have not received 
                much attention in artificial neural network research. Here, a biologically inspired feedback 
                mechanism which gates rectified linear units is proposed. On the MNIST dataset, autoencoders 
                with feedback show faster convergence, better performance, and more robustness to noise compared
                 to their counterparts without feedback. Some benefits, although less pronounced and less consistent, 
                 can be observed when networks with feedback are applied on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

                Title: <strong>Predicting Protein Levels In Cells </strong><br>
                Abstract: This article presents linear regression and support
                vector regression as techniques to predict
                protein expressions. Various feature selection
                techniques and, in the latter case, kernels are
                examined with respect to their influence on prediction
                performance. Both linear regression
                with prior feature selection on the Lasso, as
                well as support vector regression with a radial
                basis function kernel prove to be useful prediction
                techniques. Including gene data in the feature
                space yields very limited success. Datasets
                from different tissues prove to be not directly
                compatible.
