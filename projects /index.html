                Title: <strong>Feedback-Gated Rectified Linear Units </strong><br>
                Abstract: Feedback connections play a prominent role in the human brain but have not received 
                much attention in artificial neural network research. Here, a biologically inspired feedback 
                mechanism which gates rectified linear units is proposed. On the MNIST dataset, autoencoders 
                with feedback show faster convergence, better performance, and more robustness to noise compared
                 to their counterparts without feedback. Some benefits, although less pronounced and less consistent, 
                 can be observed when networks with feedback are applied on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

                Title: <strong>Predicting Protein Levels In Cells </strong><br>
                Abstract: This article presents linear regression and support
                vector regression as techniques to predict
                protein expressions. Various feature selection
                techniques and, in the latter case, kernels are
                examined with respect to their influence on prediction
                performance. Both linear regression
                with prior feature selection on the Lasso, as
                well as support vector regression with a radial
                basis function kernel prove to be useful prediction
                techniques. Including gene data in the feature
                space yields very limited success. Datasets
                from different tissues prove to be not directly
                compatible.
